**Objective:** Analyze Lending Club loan data to identify patterns associated with loan defaults and help the company minimize future credit risk.
**Skills** -Data cleaning and preprocessing
           -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
           -Feature engineering
           -Loan default prediction
           -Business insight generation
           -Data visualization

  **Key Questions answered** -Which loan features are most associated with defaults?
                             -  What is the average interest rate by loan grade and default status?
                             - Are certain employment lengths or income levels riskier?
                             - Can we build a predictive model to flag risky applications?

  **Outcome** - Identified that **high interest rates**, **low credit scores**, and **longer loan terms** are major contributors to default.
              - Specific risk profiles (e.g., self-employed with low income and Grade E+) were flagged for enhanced manual review.
              - Model can assist Lending Club in filtering out potentially default-prone borrowers during loan approval.
